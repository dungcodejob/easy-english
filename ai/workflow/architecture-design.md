Follow this workflow strictly:

Step 1 – Solution Architecture
- Summarize business goals
- Identify constraints
- Propose system-level architecture

Step 2 – Software Architecture
- Choose architectural style
- Design module and layer structure
- Define dependency rules

Step 3 – DDD Review
- Identify bounded contexts
- Suggest aggregates and entities

Step 4 – Evolution Path
- Describe how the system can evolve over time
- Avoid premature optimization

Output must be structured by step.
